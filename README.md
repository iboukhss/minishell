# Minishell

## TODO

- Learn as much information as possible about the subject
  - Use GNU Bash as reference
  - Understand processes, signals, fork, pipe, ect.
  - Find ideas for parsing
- Establish the project goals clearly (important!)
- Agree upon rules to make collaboration easy (git flow? trunk based?)
- Divide the work (parsing? execution?)
- Lay down a solid fundation to build upon
- Schedule regular (weekly?) check-ins to review progress

Things to keep in mind:

- Make sure to stay in sync even when working on different parts of the code, i.e., try to understand the codebase as a whole
- Make sure to test the code as much as possible
- Focus on making it work, then making it right

Things to avoid:

- Don't get blackholed
